# STM32-Microcontroller
## Implementing Drivers of STM32F103C8T6 ARM Cortex M based Microcontroller
## All of these codes are built by using Eclipse IDE with ARM-Plugin and ARM-GCC toolchain installed. ARM Keil uVision5 was used in debugging and testing.
#### This Repository contains the implemnted Drivers :
#### 1- RCC
#### 2- GPIO
#### 3- NVIC
#### 4- EXTI
#### 5- AFIO
#### 6- Systick
#### 7- USART
#### 8- TIMER
#### 9- ADC
